# Install Tectonic on VMware with Terraform

Following this guide will deploy a Tectonic cluster within your VMware vSphere infrastructure .

Generally, the VMware platform templates adhere to the standards defined by the project [conventions][conventions] and [generic platform requirements][generic]. This document aims to document the implementation details specific to the VMware platform.

## Prerequsities

1. Download the latest Container Linux Stable OVA from; https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-on-vmware.html.
1. Import `coreos_production_vmware_ova.ova` into vCenter. For the most part all settings can be kept as is, however in "Customize template" you *must* change "DHCP Support for Interface 0" to **"no"**. See [1802](https://github.com/coreos/bugs/issues/1802)
1. Resize the Virtual Machine Disk size to 30 GB or larger
1. Convert the Container Linux image into a Virtual Machine template.
1. Pre-Allocated IP addresses for the cluster and pre-create DNS records
1. Register for Tectonic [Account][account]

## DNS and IP address allocation

Prior to the start of setup create required DNS records. Below is a sample table of 3 etcd nodes, 2 master nodes and 2 worker nodes. 

| Record | Type | Value |
|------|-------------|:-----:|
|mycluster.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.30 |
|mycluster.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.31 |
|mycluster-k8s.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.20 |
|mycluster-k8s.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.21 |
|mycluster-worker-0.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.30 |
|mycluster-worker-1.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.31 |
|mycluster-master-0.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.20 |
|mycluster-master-1.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.21 |
|mycluster-etcd-0.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.10 |
|mycluster-etcd-1.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.11 |
|mycluster-etcd-2.mycompany.com | A | 192.168.246.12 |

See [Tectonic on Baremetal DNS documentation][baremetaldns] for general DNS Requirements.

## Getting Started

Below steps need to be executed on machine that has network connectivity to VMware vCenter API and SSH access to Tectonic Master Server(s).

First, [download][downloadterraform] and install Terraform. 

After downloading, you will need to source this new binary in your `$PATH`. Run this command to add it to your path:

```
$ export PATH=$/path/to/terraform:$PATH
```

Now we're ready to specify our cluster configuration.

## Customize the deployment

Customizations to the base installation live in `examples/terraform.tfvars.<flavor>`. Export a variable that will be your cluster identifier:

```
$ export CLUSTER=my-cluster
```

Create a build directory to hold your customizations and copy the example file into it:

```
$ mkdir -p build/${CLUSTER}
$ cp examples/terraform.tfvars.vmware build/${CLUSTER}/terraform.tfvars
$ cd build/${CLUSTER}/
```

Edit the parameters with your VMware infrastructure details. View all of the [VMware][vmware] specific options and [the common Tectonic variables][vars].

## Deploy the cluster

Get the modules that Terraform will use to create the cluster resources:

```
$ terraform get ../../platforms/vmware
```

Test out the plan before deploying everything:

```
$ terraform plan ../../platforms/vmware
```

Next, deploy the cluster:

```
$ terraform apply ../../platforms/vmware
```

This should run for a little bit, and when complete, your Tectonic cluster should be ready on: https://$tectonic_cluster_name.$tectonic_base_domain. You can use the `kubeconfig` file in build/<cluster>/generated folder.

If you encounter any issues, please file an issue with the repository.

## Delete the cluster

To delete your cluster, run:

```
$ terraform destroy ../../platforms/vmware
```
